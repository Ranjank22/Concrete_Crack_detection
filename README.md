# Concrete_Crack_detection
# Objective: 
The objective is to develop a binary image classification model that can classify images of concrete structures as cracked or uncracked using deep convolutional neural networks.
# Dataset: 
The dataset consists of two folders: train and test2. The train folder contains 7501 images of cracked structures and 7467 images of uncracked structures. 
The test folder contains 2000 unlabelled images. The dataset is adapted from SDNET 2018 dataset3.
# Evaluation: 
The evaluation metric is Mean F1-Score, which measures the accuracy, precision, and recall of the model.
